For my Task Manager App, I had a few issues when creating my code. 
My first problem was getting the treeview to display my tasks list.
I solved this problem by changing my variable names to make each one unique. 
In addition, my program had issues with my constructor class, Tasks. 
The issue I faced was because I didnâ€™t initialise the class correctly.
