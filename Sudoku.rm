#Sudoku Game - how it works
The sudoku game works by first printing a pre-determined 'board'. after the board is printed the user is asked for three inputs a number, to go on the board, a row and column
number between one and nine before subtracting one from the row and columns to get the index position. My code then checks the index position of both lists to check if the number
is the same as the one in the row and column of the answer as well as checking the index position of the board with the positions of row and column equal zero. If the number
meats these criteria then the board will update with the number being added to the grid in the index position. However if the number is not in the answer in the index position
inputted then the code will continue without updating the board instead printing an error message. on the other hand if the number in the board does not equal zero as the 
correct number is already in place then the board will not update and an error message is displayed. After this stage the boards are compared again based on all index positions
to check if the board is completed. if the board and answer are identicle then the player is asked if they want to replay at which point the program will either end or reset the
board based on the input of the user. If the user enters a row column or number above nine then an error is sent back to the user and inputts are required to be re entered.
