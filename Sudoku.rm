For my Sudoku App, I had a few issues. I had previously made a sudoku using pygame however for this task I was not allowed to use functions or imports as a result I generated my sudoku board using a pre generated board from a sudoku game I have previously played in newspapers. I also had an issue regarding integers and iteration. The problem being an “in” being in the place of a “==” in my if statement. I had a few more issues regarding the same issue due to previous attempts to fix my previously mentioned problem.
